## 1. Understanding GSoC

* **What is GSoC?**
  Google Summer of Code pairs university-aged students with open-source organizations for a paid summer coding project.
* **Why it matters:**

  * Real-world software development experience
  * Mentorship by seasoned open-source contributors
  * Networking within global developer communities

---

## 2. Early Preparation (6–9 Months Before)

1. **Familiarize Yourself with Open Source Workflow**

   * Git & GitHub/GitLab fundamentals: branching, PRs, issue tracking
   * Continuous integration (CI) basics (Travis CI, GitHub Actions)
   * Code review etiquette and community norms

2. **Identify Your Strengths & Interests**

   * Languages/frameworks you know well (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust)
   * Domains of passion (e.g., data science, web dev, embedded systems)

3. **Time Management & Calendar**

   * Mark key GSoC dates (organization application, community bonding, coding period)
   * Allocate weekly “open-source contribution” sessions in your schedule

---

## 3. Selecting the Right Organization & Project

* **Research Prospective Organizations**

  * Browse [GSoC Archive Organizations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/)

* **Evaluate Project Ideas**

  * Check “good first issue” tags in their issue trackers
  * Gauge project maturity: documentation quality, issue volume, release frequency

* **Align with Personal Goals**

  * Seek projects that map to your career aspirations
  * Balance novelty vs. feasibility: prefer realistic scopes

---

## 4. Building Real-World Contributions (3–6 Months Before)

> *“Show, don’t tell.”*

1. **Start Small, Scale Up**

   * Fix typos or improve README/website copy
   * Tackle a “good first issue” to learn codebase internals
2. **Document Your Journey**

   * Publish short blog posts or GitHub Gists outlining your contributions
   * Share in community chats (Slack/Discord) to build recognition
3. **Demonstrate Consistency**

   * Aim for at least **5 quality PRs** before proposal submission
   * Engage in code reviews: comment helpfully on others’ PRs

## 5. Crafting a Stand-Out Proposal (1–2 Months Before)

A strong proposal convinces both mentors and admins that you can deliver.
